You need to follow the @implementation_plan.md one by one and complete a phase.
If you have any question that is confusing then you can ask the user before starting the phase. Set the phase as in progress in the @implementation_plan. md. Then commit to git locally.

The user will review and give feedback then the user asks you to continue you need to come back to the @implementation_plan.md, mark that phase as completed and then move on.
